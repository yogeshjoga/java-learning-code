# Polymorphism
Polymorphism :
    If one task is performed in differnt ways it is known as Polymorphism.
    for example:
            Smart phone calling vs Landline phone calling
            both are convaying the voices but differnt ways.
        In JAVA, we use method overloding and method overriding to achieve the Polymorphism.

```java
  These are Two types of polymorphisms in java 
      1 Compile-Time Polymorphism
      2 Run-Time Polymorphism
      we can perform by using  Method Overloading and Method Overriding
      if we overload the static method in java it is known as the Compile Time Polymorphism.
      if we override the instance Method is known as the runtime Polymorphism.


Static Binding and Dynamic Binding
static binding and dynamic binding in java
Connecting a method call to the method body is known as binding.

There are two types of binding

Static Binding (also known as Early Binding).
Dynamic Binding (also known as Late Binding).
