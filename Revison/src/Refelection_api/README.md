# Reflection API's

```
Reflection API:
we can modify the private variables and private methods
by using the reflection API concept in Java.

//it's getting all the variables from my class class 
Field[] field = my class.class.getClass().getDecelearFields();

//
The Java Reflection API is a powerful tool that allows you to inspect and modify the behavior of a Java program at runtime. It can be used to do things like:

Inspect the structure of a class: You can use reflection to get information about the fields, methods, and constructors of a class. This can be useful for things like debugging, documentation, and code generation.

Invoke methods at runtime: You can use reflection to invoke methods on objects, even if they are private or protected. This can be useful for things like dynamic loading of classes and runtime polymorphism.

Create new instances of classes: You can use reflection to create new instances of classes, even if they are abstract or sealed. This can be useful for things like dynamic object creation and testing.

Get and set field values: You can use reflection to get and set the values of fields, even if they are private or protected. This can be useful for things like dynamic data binding and property management.
