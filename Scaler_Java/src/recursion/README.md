* It helps us in solving bigger problems/ complex problems in as simple way
* you can convert recursion solution iteration and recursion and vice versa
* Space complexity is not constant because of recursive calls in stack memory.
* It helps us break down bigger problems into smaller problems.

Visualizing Recursion Very imp

user online Recursive tree mappers

NOTE:
how to understand and approach a problem

1 Identify if you can break down the problem into smaller problem
2 write the recurring relation if needed
3 Draw the recursive tree
4 About the Tree:
1 See the flow of functions and how they are getting into the stack
2 Identify and focus on the left tree calls and right tree calls
3 Draw the tree and pointers again and again using pen and paper
4 use a debugger to see the flow
5 See how the values are returned at each step
6 See where the function call will come out of the stack, you will come out of the main function.

Variable points if you know how to use variables 100% recursion is completed

Variables  :
1 Arguments
2 Return type
3 Body of Function

Type of recurrence relations

1 Linear recurrence relations
2 Divide and conquer recurrence relations
Tip:
Do not overthink





Recursion:
*          we can print 2 ways
*          -  Before pushing into Stack
*          -  Before pop into Stack
