# Class and Object
Class
    Class is a keyword which is used to create the non-primitive datatype or user defined datatype by encapsulating the properties and behavior of a particular object
    in the form of Global variables and Global methods.

    The Class is Represented by the blue print of object and it is consider as logical entity.


  NOTE:
        A Class is which Represented an object should not have main method since it a logical entity and the blueprint is also know as business logic Class.


  object
      object According to JAVA object is a block of memory created during the runtime.
      In OOP object is an instance of a class or it is a mirror image of blueprint class and they are consider an real entity.

    According to JAVA conventions object is a blueprint should be created with in another class containing the main method called user logic Class.


    NOTE:
         OOP  it's paradigm which co-relates real time  scenarios into java perspective.
         In OOP we can Represented every object in the following manner.

    class : 
  Def:class is a keyword which is used to define non primitive datatype or user defined datatype. (we can encapsulate the properties and behaviours of outer objects in the form of variables and methods respectively within the java program.) According to OOP,class is used represent the blueprint of real time objects. 

  Note: In any class which representing the blueprint should not have main(String[]) according java convention. a blueprint class is known as logical entity or Business logic class. 
  Object ID

  Def:In java,objects are block of memory created during the runtime. According to oop, we can consider object as instance of a class. or mirror image of a blueprint 

  note: objects are considered as real time entities and the objects of a blueprint class must be created within the class having main method called user logic class. 

  According to java conventions, If any property is keep on changing for each and every object that we create, then the property must be taken as non static variable in java otherwise static variable. and if any method depends upon any one of the non static property,then the method must be non static method.

job of new oparator
    create an object with the reference
    load all the nsm withf defualt values
    execute the all initializers from top to bottom order
    calls the constructor to intialize the non static properties
    once object is created reference is given



    wap to create the bluerint of box, where in some boxes are 2-D and some are 3-D boxes create a method called as disply whichprovides the properties of the box objects. create a user logic with 3 box object wehrein 2 boxes are 2-D and another 3-D boxes and siplay their properties by calling disply behaviour.


    WAP to create the blue print of student with the properties name 10th percentage, 12th percentage and degree percetnage. some students have completed upto 10th some upto 12th and reamaining upto degree with  a behavior display with display the properties of the student object.
    create a user logic with 4 students objects where in 2 ompleted upto 10th and one upto 12th and reamining upto degree. Display therir behaviour also.
